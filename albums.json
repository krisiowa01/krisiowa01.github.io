I wanted to show my dad this cool wooden path that felt like it was hovering over a secret pond. The road I usually drove down was blocked off and we came from another way but I was determined to show my dad and eventually found it. Sadly, the pond was gone and nothing was left but dead brush and it didn't look so magical anymore." },

Her girlfriend Erikka was going to take all the photos however, things didn't work out as planned and the three of us found the night already upon us so we headed downtown to see if Cedar Rapids had better Christmas decorations than Marion. The answer: definitely NOT! " },
