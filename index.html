            <h2 class="headline">Travel</h2>
            <p class="summary">The Travel collection wanders through unfamiliar streets, quiet coastlines, and fleeting moments that only exist when I'm far from home. Each frame captures the feeling of movement — the blur of passing landscapes, the stillness of early mornings, and the stories tucked into every corner of the world. These images aren’t just about where I go, but who I become along the way.</p>

            <h2 class="headline">Portraits</h2>
            <p class="summary">The Portraits collection is woven from the faces and moments of the people who matter most — family, friends, and the quiet connections that shape my life. These images hold laughter, inside jokes, shared history, and the kind of comfort that only comes from being truly known. Every photograph is a small tribute to the relationships that anchor me.</p>

            <h2 class="headline">Nature</h2>
            <p class="summary">Nature is a breath of stillness — towering cliffs, quiet forests, and the raw textures of the earth. This album focuses on the moments when the natural world feels larger than life yet intimately close. From sweeping vistas to delicate details, each photograph is an invitation to pause, look closer, and feel the quiet power of the outdoors.</p>

            <h2 class="headline">Iowa</h2>
            <p class="summary">A quiet tribute to the heartland — open skies, golden fields, and the kind of calm that settles into you like a familiar song. These photographs linger on the details that often go unnoticed: the curve of a gravel road, the warmth of late‑day sun, the rhythm of small‑town life. It’s a portrait of simplicity, honesty, and the beauty of everyday moments.</p>

            <h2 class="headline">Nevada</h2>
            <p class="summary">The Nevada collection moves between desert silence and neon glow, revealing a landscape of contrasts. Harsh sunlight, endless horizons, and the surreal geometry of the desert meet the electric pulse of city nights. These images explore the tension between isolation and spectacle, showing Nevada as a place where emptiness and energy coexist.</p>
